<!-- On Windows machines setting withJansi to true enables ANSI
         color code interpretation by the Jansi library. This requires
         org.fusesource.jansi:jansi:1.8 on the class path.  Note that
         Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X
         support ANSI color codes by default. -->
