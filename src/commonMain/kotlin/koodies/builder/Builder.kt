/**
 * # Builder
 * This library defines a builder as follows:
 *
 * > *A builder is an object that builds instances of type [R]*
 * > *using a build argument of functional type [T].*
 *
 * Builders are distinguished between context-free builders and
 * those providing a context to their build argument [T].
 *
 * Using a context can be for different reasons:
 * 1) it can hold the build information to create instances of type [R]
 * 2) it can provide functions to ease the building process
 * 3) it can provide domain functions to implement an embedded domain specific language.
 *
 * By separation of the two concepts `builder` and `context`,
 * the context can be kept free from technical aspects that would otherwise
 * pollute the namespace and decrease usability.
 *
 * In this library, all builders with a context have the same three building steps.
 *
 * ## Build Process
 *
 * ### Step 1: Context Creation
 * A context is created to hold build information, provide helpful functions or
 * to model a domain specific language. If the context has a state a new instance
 * needs to be created for each build to guarantee thread-safety on all platforms.
 *
 * ### Step 2: Context Initialization
 * A build is triggered by invocation of the [build] function.
 * The argument passed to the build function is a [Init], that is, a lambda with
 * the just provided context as its receiver object. While the [Init] operates
 * on the context, it manipulates the context's state.
 *
 * ### Step 3: Instantiation
 * The last step consists of using the modified context state to create an
 * instance of [R].

/**
 * Convenience interface for a [Builder] that features an immutable context.
 * Consequently the build process is restricted to transformations of the build
 * argument itself using functions provided by the context.
 *
 * What sounds like a downside is quite handy to model **micro domain specific
 * languages** of which the scope reaches from
 * hereÂ ðŸ‘‰Â `{Â "mini".DSLÂ toÂ resultÂ }`Â ðŸ‘ˆÂ toÂ here.
 *
 * The build can only be finalized if the transformations lead to a return
 * value of type [R] (respectively [S] if post-processing is applied).
 *
 * If all transformations are provided by the context (i.e. transitions only
 * possible with the context; or non-final intermediary states) and can be
 * chained, crisp mini domain specific languages can be implemented.
 *
 * **Examples**
 * ```kotlin
 * DockerImage { "bkahlert" / "libguestfs" tag "latest" }
 * ```
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * DockerMounts {
 *     "/some/directory" mountAs bind at "/app/data"
 *     HomeDir mountAt "/home"
 * }
