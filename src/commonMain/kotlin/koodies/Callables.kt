/**
 * Returns a callable property that delegates all invocations to the
 * referenced callable and returns the result.
 *
 * This type of delegation in particular useful to make existing functionality
 * re-usable without disclosing the origin resp. without providing a too large
 * scope of functionality.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * *Implementation*
 * ```kotlin
 * val function by callable(::someFunction)
 *
 *      ðŸ‘‰ reference to function or callable property
 *
 *
 * val memberFunction by callable(SomeClass()::someMemberFunction)
 *
 *      ðŸ‘‰ reference to member function / member callable property
 *         of instance of SomeClass
 *
 * ```
 *
 * *Caller Perspective*
 * ```kotlin
 * function(p1, p2)          âžœ someFunction(p1, p2)
 *
 * memberFunction(p1) { â€¦ }  âžœ [SomeObject instance].someMemberFunction(p1) { â€¦ }
 * ```
 *
 * ***Note:** The [callable] is optional. Shorthand: **`val function by ::someFunction`***
 *
 * ***Note:** References to functions and callable properties can be used,
 *            as are both are function types.*
 *
